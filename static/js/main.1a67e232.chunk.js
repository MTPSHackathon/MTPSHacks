We wanted to not only attract audiences, but also give them a greater grasp of the situation. This vision inspired us to implement many features, such as the merch, chat, and photo collage.","description":"Our project has many features that allow for our intended audience to get a better grasp of the situation as well as donate. Starting with the home page, there is a nav bar that contains the buttons to access any part of the site. Within the home page is our objective, pictures of Ghana, and a video. Located on the bottom is group information. The merch contains a triple-lined nav button that pops up with the different sections of the site. The main features of that page include the table, which calculates the price automatically once the values are filled, as well as the PayPal button, which allows for the user to pay money. The photo collage also contains a triple-nav button, and it has a photo collage that is layed out in an appealing manner, with different sizes of images placed in different spots. The project page shares the same layout as the home page, but contains text on what people can do to help the children in Ghana. The Donate page includes a form that person can fill out, including name, amount they want to contribute, credit card number, as well as a radio button for gender. There is also a PayPal button, but it serves as a submit button. Once the person submits, the submitted info will be shown, and the person can click on the PayPal button to donate. The About button contains the group members\' names as well as their vision. The chat page contains a box listing the available people as well as a chat box to chat. There is also a box that features the text sent by other people. Finally, the Potato store contains a carousel feature that allows the images to move every 3 seconds, as well as an option to click forward and backward between the images. Below the carousel are the different sections of products sold as well as the images of them. Finally, there is a text that features our vision as well as the PayPal button. Almost all pages, with the exception of the potato store, have a golden background.","challenge":"The main challenge was time. Some members are not always available at the same time as others. Also, there were some challenges when adding the chat feature, as that feature initially didn\'t work. There were some issues we had when trying to identify the error in the code and fixing it. Despite this, we pushed on and fixed the major issues of our website.","accomplishments":"We are rather content with the results, but some major features that we believe are the highlights include the chat, which allows our intended audience to communicate with the children in Ghana, the merch feature that does basic mathematics to calculate the cost of products purchased, the template for the home page of a \\"professional shopping page\\", the layout of some of the pages, the triple-lined nav, and the PayPal donation button.","learn":"We learned how to collaborate with each other to execute specific tasks regarding the development of the website. In addition, we also learned how to effectively utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to create a primitive form of a website. Finally, we learned how to take responsibility for one another. To explain this into detail, every individual is not available at the same time, so to compensate for that, we had to work at whenever time is possible for us to complete the website.","nextSteps":"We plan on expanding what we can do with the website, including the addition of new features on the potato store (hopefully, we can make it into a full-fledged store) and expand on the interaction between the audience as well as the students in Ghana, in order to not only entice the audience, but also enrich them with this new knowledge about the daily lives of the children in Ghana."},{"Timestamp":"6/19/2020 19:36:18","email":"vasudevangovar@marlboro.k12.nj.us","memberNames":"Vasudevan Govardhanen & Anton Lavrenov","teamName":"Vasudevan and Anton\'s Social Good Website","category":"SOCIAL GOOD CHALLENGE: build a website for the orphanage in Africa adopted by MTPS","link1":"https://the-actual-social-good-hackathon--vasudevangovard.repl.co/","link2":"https://repl.it/talk/share/SOCIAL-GOOD-HACKATHON/42460","inspiration":"A bunch of other non profit websites like the Sivananda orphanage website","description":"We made a website that persuades people to donate to the Vima Children\'s home.","challenge":"Meeting up at the correct time and learning some javascript.","accomplishments":"How our website looks and our new ability to program in javascript.","learn":"How to make slideshows, create coherent links, javascript elements, the list goes on and on.","nextSteps":"We want to make the website big and make an actual impact in the world."},{"Timestamp":"6/19/2020 20:56:17","email":"ayanpatel@marlboro.k12.nj.us","memberNames":"Ayan Patel & Suchit Basineni","teamName":"Coding Kids","category":"SOCIAL GOOD CHALLENGE: build a website for the orphanage in Africa adopted by MTPS","link1":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mSOyzggz6c4kp1vGrZAjfQrzT_IdGPop/view?usp=sharing","link2":"https://mtps-and-think-kindness--ayanpatel5.repl.co/","inspiration":"We were not inspired by one thing.
