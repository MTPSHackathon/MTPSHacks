                        A hackathon is when teams of students work together toward creating a unique or innovative project using computer programming skills. Hackathons are known to increase coding knowledge and foster collaborative problem-solving skills as students build something useful to make the world a better place.

                        Prior to school closures due to COVID-19, Marlboro Township Public Schools planned for an after-school hackathon for middle school students in collaboration with Junior Achievement of NJ. Rather than cancel because of COVID-19, the program was redesigned to take place virtually so students could engage in a creative, collaborative project with their peers under the guidance of teachers, high school student mentors, and industry professionals. Under Morgan Grossâ€™ leadership, all stakeholders came together to revise the program to foster creativity and innovation at a time when students needed these unique learning experiences the most.
